# UniHD Card

Flipper Zero app project for Uni Heidelberg DESFire student cards.

The current implementation is a production-quality DESFire reader/inspector app (live read + `.nfc` dump loading) with a multi-scene UI and Flipper App Catalog metadata.

See full app docs in [`unihd_flipper_app/README.md`](unihd_flipper_app/README.md).
